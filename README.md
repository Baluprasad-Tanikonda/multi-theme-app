# 🎨 Multi-Theme Switcher App

A responsive, React-based web application that allows users to switch between three distinct UI themes — minimalist, dark mode, and colorful card layout — with persistent preferences and dynamic routing.

---

## 📌 Description

This project is a multi-theme web application built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It demonstrates a dynamic theme switcher with three unique design experiences:

- **Theme 1**: Minimalist light theme with a clean sans-serif layout.
- **Theme 2**: Dark mode with a sidebar and bold serif fonts.
- **Theme 3**: Colorful, playful theme with a card-based grid and Google Fonts.

The application also fetches live data from [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/products), persists the selected theme across reloads using `localStorage`, and includes navigation between pages via React Router.
